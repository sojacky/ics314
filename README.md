DELIVERABLE 1
The	first	team	deliverable is	worth	5 points	and	is	due	in	Week	7.	
Teams	will	have	short	(15	minute)	meetings	with	the	TA	where	you	will
demonstrate	that:
• your	team has	registered	your project	on	github
• everyone	in	the group	has	used	a calendaring	system	of	their	choice	to	create	
a	.ics	event	file	and	has	looked	at	the	content	of	that	file	with	a	text	editor	
such	(such	as	vim or	textedit).	“Reverse	engineering”	.ics	files	can	offer	
significant	insight.		
• your	team	has	functioning	code,	no	matter	how	minimal:	You	must	
demonstrate	code that	generates	a	.ics	file	for	a	simple,	single	occurrence
event	such	as:		Study	for	exam,	1pm-2pm	HST,	12	August	2015,	in	Hamilton	
Library.		You	must	then	demonstrate	that	the	calendar	program	of	your	
choice	(say,	google	calendar)	successfully	reads	and	processes	the	.ics	files	
you	generate.	
• your	system	must	allow	the		use	of	the	“geographic	position”	field	described	
in	section	3.8.1.6	of	the	RFC.		Events	are	not	required	to	use	the	field,	but	if	
the	information	is	provided	by	the	user,	your	system	must	support	it	by	
putting	it	into	the	event	file.
• Your	systems	must	also	implement		the	“classification”	field	as	described	in	
section	3.8.1.3	of	the RFC.		Events	are	not	required	to	use	the	field,	but	if	the	
information	is	provided	by	the	user,	your	system	must	support	it	by	putting	
it	into	the	event	file
• In	the	real-world,	your	code	would	be	embedded	in	a	larger	calendaring	
system,	so	don’t	worry	much	about	a	user	interface.		In	fact,	to	create	 .ics	
files	your	user	interface	can	be	command	line	or	simple	drop-down	menus
